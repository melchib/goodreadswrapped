I’ve read her first book, The First Bad Man at least three times on account of it being the only book I owned from ages 18-23 (this is a joke but not really). Maybe because of this, reading this novel felt like going inside my best friend’s head and defending her 100% despite not fully agreeing with her actions. Just the same as the protagonist in her first novel, I don’t understand her and yet I understand her better than I know myself. Throughout this book, she’s doing stuff that I would never do, and yet I am her, and you know what.. I AM her. Not that she is me, but i am her. When I read this book, I was her. If that makes sense.

I believe he is not only one of the best YA writers, but also one of the best fiction writers in general, and while his books are technically listed under YA, they appeal to adults as well.  This book is John Green at his finest, you become so attached to the characters and the settings that you will laugh, and cry, and feel all of the emotions that the main characters at the same time that they are feeling them.  John does a great job of ending the book in a way that makes you think about everything that has happened and will happen in the future with the story which is nice because it lets you interpret what will happen after the book ends.  I have found myself still thinking about this book four months after I first read it, and ended up reading it again a second time because it has hit a soft spot somewhere inside me. <br/>I cannot say enough good things about this book, please go pick it up right now and read the entire thing.",,,1,0
